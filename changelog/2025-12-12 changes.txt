IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:

1. POST /borrow/<int:item_id>
	- Endpoint for borrowing items.
	- Error handling included.
	- Requires user_id in the request body (JSON).

2. POST /returns/<int:item_id>
	- Endpoint for returning items.
	- Error handling included.
	- Requires user_id in the request body (JSON).

3. GET /transactions
	- Retrieves all transactions (borrow and return) in the system.
	- Error handling included.

4. Transaction Model
	- Added Transaction model to record all borrow/return actions with timestamps.

5. Blueprints
	- Created borrow_bp for borrowing and returning operations.
	- Registered users_bp and borrow_bp in app.py.

6. GET /transactions/items/<int:item_id>
	- Shows all users who have borrowed a specific item, along with transaction details.
	- Error handling included.

7. GET /transactions/users/<int:user_id>
	- Shows all transactions performed by a specific user.

PENDING IMPROVEMENTS / TO-DO:

1. YAML Specification Updates
	- Update OpenAPI YAML file to reflect new endpoints and modified schemas.
	- Incorporate updated components, including new error handling methods, response formats, and 
	  any additional schema changes introduced during the code rework.
	- Ensure /borrow, /returns, and /transactions endpoints accurately match implementation.

2. Missing YAML Definitions
	- /transactions/<int:item_id>
	- /transactions/<int:user_id>

3. Further Testing
	- Conduct additional testing to account for potential edge cases and unforeseen scenarios that 
	  may not have been considered during initial development.
	- Ensure robustness, error handling, and data integrity across all endpoints
